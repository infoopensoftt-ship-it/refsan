The AI engineer successfully guided the Refsan Türkiye Technical Service Program from its initial state, which involved a non-functional React frontend, to a robust application with a static HTML/JavaScript frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Initial efforts focused on fixing critical login and routing issues, transitioning from a React-based frontend to a static one. The AI diligently addressed persistent login problems, deployment environment discrepancies (proxy vs. Kubernetes Ingress), and data synchronization issues (demo data passwords).

Significant feature additions include role-based access control, comprehensive admin features (user management, customer/repair CRUD, stock management), technician functionalities (repair creation, search), and customer self-service. The AI also implemented UX/UI improvements, such as PWA support, consistent Refsan branding with an orange theme and grey background, and replaced unprofessional emoji icons with a more professional aesthetic. The latest work involves enhancing repair management with interactive status updates (Approve/Reject), a calendar-based filter for repairs, and displaying customer details in the repair modal. Challenges were predominantly frontend JavaScript bugs, scope issues, and persistent cache-related problems requiring detailed debugging and re-evaluation of previous assumptions.

<product_requirements>
The Refsan Türkiye Technical Service Program is designed for ceramic machinery service requests, supporting three user roles with a Turkish interface:
1.  **Admin:** Manages all customers, service records, users (including role updates), generates technician performance reports (pending implementation), updates/deletes records, performs system resets (delete all data, create demo data), creates repair records, and receives notifications for new customers/repairs/status changes.
2.  **Technician:** Creates service records (with image/document uploads), views their own customers/records, and can search for customers. Can cancel repair records.
3.  **Customer:** Creates and views their own service records.
The application includes a notification system (with sound and clear functionality), modals for reports, clickable notifications for repair details, and is intended to be a Progressive Web App (PWA) featuring the Refsan Türkiye logo. Recent enhancements requested include a consistent orange theme, grey background, Refsan Technical Türkiye branding across all pages, removal of role selection from user registration (admin to manage roles), stock management as a separate admin section, and advanced repair management features like status update buttons (Approve/Reject/Process) with SMS notification (temporarily disabled for popup display), and calendar filtering for repairs.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a decoupled full-stack architecture. The backend is built with Python using FastAPI, providing a RESTful API. The frontend, originally a React application, now uses static HTML pages with vanilla JavaScript for API interaction.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's latest request to enhance the repair detail modal in . The specific tasks involved adding Onayla (Approve) and Reddet (Reject) buttons, displaying customer phone and repair date information within the modal, and ensuring that once a repair is approved or rejected, it moves to the corresponding section in the dashboard (e.g., 'onaylananlar' for approved).

The AI engineer successfully:
1.  Analyzed the user's screenshot and understood the request for modal enhancements.
2.  Updated the  in  to include dynamic display of customer phone and date, and added the Onayla and Reddet buttons, removing previous emoji icons.
3.  Modified the  Pydantic model in  to include a  field.
4.  Updated the backend  endpoint to fetch and store  when a repair is created.
5.  Updated the backend  endpoint to retrieve and populate  for existing repairs by fetching customer details for each repair.
6.  Restarted both backend and frontend services.

The last message from the AI engineer was acknowledging the user's request to temporarily disable SMS notification and instead show a popup message and automatically move the repair to the correct section after a status change. This means the frontend logic for handling post-status-update visual feedback needs to be adjusted.

<optional_next_step>
Adjust frontend logic to show a popup message and move the repair to the correct section after a status update, disabling SMS for now.
